Layouts
=====

A repository of email layouts for use with customer.io 

### Usage

Copy and paste straight in to your customer.io account, or modify these themes as you like.

### Note

These layouts are designed only for use with Customer.io. We use the open source tool Premailer to process and inline style tags. This makes these layouts easier to maintain, but unusable with other mailers that don't inline CSS for you.
